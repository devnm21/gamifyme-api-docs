    # Welcome to the GamifyMe API documentation. 
    #### Please note that this API requires authentication using the `x-gamifyme-token header`. 
    
    You can find your API key in `API Docs` section of your dashboard
    To authenticate, please click on the 'Authorize' button and enter your API key.
    
    ## Rate Limit
    For the purpose of beta the APIs are *rate-limited to a maximum of 500 requests per day* (refer `X-GamifyMe-Rate-Limit` in response as it might change)  per API Key(User).
    
    
    When the limit is exceeded, the server will return a 429 Too Many Requests status code.
    
    To check the current rate limit status, the response headers include the `X-GamifyMe-Rate-Limit` and `X-GamifyMe-Remaining-Calls` headers.
    
    The `X-GamifyMe-Remaining-Calls` header indicates the total number of requests allowed for rest of the day while `X-GamifyMe-Rate-Limit` header
    indicates the remaining number of requests available for the current day.
    
    You can also refer `X-GamifyMe-Limit-Reset-In` which is when the limit will reset (the given unit will be in seconds)
